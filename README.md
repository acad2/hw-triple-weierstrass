# Implementing Complete Formulas on Weierstrass Curves in Hardware
Scalar multiplication unit for Elliptic curve cryptography. This repository is for the upcoming work :

Pedro Maat C. Massolino, Joost Renes, Lejla Batina. Implementing Complete Formulas on Weierstrass Curves in Hardware.

The scalar multiplication is based on the complete formulas for Weierstrass curves presented in :

J. Renes, C. Costello, and L. Batina.  [Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1060). In Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2016: 35th Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, Vienna, Austria, May 8-12, 2016, Proceedings, Part I, pages 403–428, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2016. Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

While the hardware Montgomery multipliers are based on :

P. M. C. Massolino, L. Batina, R. Chaves, and N. Mentens. [Low Power Montgomery Modular Multiplication on Reconfigurable Systems](http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/280). Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2016/280, 2016.
